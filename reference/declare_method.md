### usage
```
declare_method(return-type, name, (function-parameter-list)) {
    ...

Declare a method.

Create an inline function `method` that returns `return-type` and takes a
parameter list consisting of the `types` without the `virtual_` marker. At least
one `types` (but not necessarily all) must be marked with `virtual_`.

When `method` is called, the dynamic types of the arguments marked with
`virtual_` are examined, and the most specific definition compatible with
`unspecified_type...` is called. If no compatible definition exists, or if
several compatible definitions exist but none of them is more specific than all
the others, the call is illegal and an error handler is executed. By default it
writes a diagnostic on `std::cerr ` and terminates the program via `abort`. The
handler can be customized.

NOTE:

* The parameter list `type` _must_ be surrounded by parentheses.

* The parameters in `types` consist of _just_ a type, e.g. `int` is correct
  but `int i` is not.

* Types that contain commas (e.g. `tuple<int, char>`) cannot be used directly as
  macro arguments. The workarounds are:
  * using an alias, e.g. `using int_char = tuple<int, char>`
  * using any C++ construct that puts parentheses around the commas,
    e.g. `decltype(std::tuple<int, int>())`
